## Demo notes
- Index is the main file and server.js is the one with all the proccesses.
- middleware are  used to manipulate the data and get authintication and documantication
- express is used to build the server with http requasts 
- jest is used to  test without creating a server which is more efficient.
- testing the server after a successful jest test the old way by running the server and seeing if the server works properly is a must befoure relasese.
